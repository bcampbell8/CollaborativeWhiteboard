##How to run:
The server needs two processes to run to serve the frontend pages and the backend server
1. Start by changing the `server_ip` value in app.config.ts to be the address of the server
2. Run `node protoserver.ts` in /src/server to start the backend server
3. Run `npm run dev` in /src/client to start the frontend server
4. View the webpage in a browser by entering the value that you put in app.config.ts followed by ":5173".
