Interactive Whiteboard project

by Braeden & Dan

------------------------------------------------------

source/ folder contains source code
testing/ contains unit and other tests
documentation/ contains various finalised diagrams and information about the project
experimentation/ contains brainstorming and communicative notes

------------------------------------------------------

How to run:
For the collaborative whiteboard app to work, a server will need to be running the 'protoserver.ts'
file. This can be done with 'npx tsx protoserver.ts' in the 'source/server' directory. The front end server will also need to be started using 'npm run dev' in the 'source/client' directory.

After that, simply enter the host IP into your browser of choice followed by the port (e.g 192.168.0.1:5173) and you'll be able to connect to a room and start drawing!
